# Using Account Features in Bubble-Twist

## How Players Use Account Features

1. **Registration/Login**
   - Players enter a username and password. The app stores these credentials securely.

2. **Progress Tracking**
   - The app automatically tracks when you clear daily, weekly, or monthly game objectives. You can view your progress or rewards based on this data.

3. **Leaderboard Participation**
   - The first time you interact with leaderboards, you are prompted for consent. Your choice is stored and respected in future sessions.

## Step-by-Step Example
1. Open the app and register or log in with a username and password.
2. Play and complete a daily challenge. The app updates your last cleared daily timestamp.
3. Check your profile to see your progress and consent status for leaderboard participation.

These features ensure your experience is personalized and your progress is saved, even if you close and reopen the app.
